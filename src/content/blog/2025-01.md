## What I Worked On

Spent the day exploring compound components and render props patterns in React. These patterns are powerful for creating flexible, reusable components.

## Key Takeaways

- Compound components work great for related UI elements
- Render props provide maximum flexibility
- Hooks have replaced many use cases for these patterns

## Reflections

Sometimes the "older" patterns are still the best solution for certain problems. It's important to have multiple tools in your toolbox.

## What I Worked On

Today I set up this website! It's been a project I've been meaning to do for a while, and I'm excited to finally have a place to share my work and thoughts.

## Reflections

Building a personal website is a great exercise in thinking about how you want to present yourself to the world. It forces you to reflect on what's important to you and what you want to share.

## Tomorrow's Goals

- Add more projects to the portfolio
- Write about a technical topic
- Update the work history with more details
