# Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, accomplishments, and any other work I might have. It is also a place to view a daily blog of work I have done and reflections.

# Tools

I want the front end of the application to be written in React. We want a responsive modern feel to the website. Everything else is flexible.

# Style and Feel

Dark space blue theme with a futuristic aesthetic. The design should feel modern and tech-forward with glowing accents, smooth animations, and clean typography.

# Workflow

For updating the blog, create markdown files with post content and push to the repository. The site will automatically rebuild and deploy with new content.

# Hosting

GitHub Pages with automatic deployment.
